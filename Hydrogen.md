## Resemblance with Group 1 & Group 17

The electronic configuration of Hydrogen is 1s<sup>1</sup>. It is  short by one electron to the corresponding noble gas configuration, He (1s<sup>2</sup>)

##### Alkali
- Lose one electron to form unipositive ions
- Form oxides, halides, sulphides

But has a very high ionization enthalpy and does not possess metallic characteristics under normal conditions. Its I.E. is more like that of halogens.

##### Halogens
- Forms a diatomic molecule
- Forms hydrides and covalent compounds

But its reactivity is very low w.r.t halogens.


## Isotopes of Hydrogen
- Protium <sup>1</sup>H<sub>1</sub>
- Deuterium <sup>2</sup>H<sub>1</sub> (Heavy Hydrogen)
- Tritium <sup>3</sup>H<sub>1</sub> (Radioactive, emits low energy $\beta$<sup>-</sup> particles)


## Preparation of Dihydrogen

##### Laboratory Preparation
1. Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>
2. Zn + 2NaOH → Na<sub>2</sub>ZnO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>

##### Commercial Production
1.
